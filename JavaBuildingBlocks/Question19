The Rabbit object from line 3 is first eligible for garbage collection immediately following line 8.
The Rabbit object from line 4 is first eligible for garbage collection immediately following line 9.
    The Rabbit object from line 3 has two references to it, one and three. The references are nulled
    out on line 6 and 8, respectively. Line 7 sets the reference four to null one, which means it has 
    no effect on garbage collection. 
    The Rabbit object on line 4 has single reference to it, two, which becomes null on line 9. 
    The Rabbit object declared on line 10 becomes eligible for garbage collection on line 12.
    Calling System.gc() has no effect on eligibility for garbage collection.
